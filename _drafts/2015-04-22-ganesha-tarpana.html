Many tantra texts prescribe the caturāvṛtti tarpaṇa, where four-fold tarpaṇas are offered to various aspects of ganapati. I've had opportunity to study the procedures detailed in the śāradā tilaka tantra, prapañcasāra, prapañchasāra sārasaṅgraha and śrīvidyā varivasyā.<br /><br />Though the essence of the ritual is the same, the total number of tarpaṇas varies, though many of the prayogas make a concerted effort to arrive at the magic number "444". In my opinion, the focus on this number is misguided, much like the attempt to force exactly 700 offerings in the durgā saptaśatī.<br /><br />The chaturavrtti&nbsp;tarpaṇa&nbsp;presupposes knowledge of the basic structure of the mahāgaṇapati yantra, though it is&nbsp;often overlooked in this context. The inner core of the yantra is composed of (1) an inner triange, (2) a ṣaṭkona (six-pointed star) &nbsp;and (3) an aśṭadala (8-petaled lotus). The outer portion of the yantra consists of the prāna elements and the outer bhūpura with the dikpālakas and their shaktis. This <a href="https://www.homam.org/poojagallery/images/Ganapathi%20yantra.jpg" target="_blank">picture</a> of a mandala version of the yantra shows it nicely, though it adds an extra 16-petaled lotus.<br /><br />The trikona and area inside the ṣaṭkona house the bījas of the mūla mantra. The ṣaṭkona houses the 6 vighneśas, and the area between the&nbsp;ṣaṭkona&nbsp;and&nbsp;aśṭadala&nbsp;houses an additional two devatā pairs. The&nbsp;aśṭadala&nbsp;houses the mūla mantra (excluding the bījas). This is the basic construction of the mahāgaṇapati&nbsp;yantra, which should be kept in mind during the&nbsp;caturāvṛtti&nbsp;tarpaṇam.<br /><br />The basic overview of the&nbsp;caturāvṛtti&nbsp;tarpaṇa is as follows:<br /><br /><ul><li>For each part of the mūla mantra</li><ul><li>Make four&nbsp;tarpaṇas&nbsp;to that part of the mantra, as part of the consciousness of gaṇeśa</li><li>Make four&nbsp;tarpaṇas&nbsp;to gaṇapati with the full mūla mantra</li></ul><li>For each devatā in the gaṇapati yantra</li><ul><li>Make four tarpaṇas to that devatā, as part of the consciousness of ganeśa</li><li>Make four tarpaṇas to gaṇapati with the full mūla mantra</li></ul></ul><br />The gaṇapati mūla mantra is commonly divided into either 28 or 10 parts<br /><br /><ul><li>Since it is consisted of 28 akṣaras, it can be divided into 28 parts</li><li>The mantra is composed of 12 words / bījas. The first 8 parts are the first eight words / bījas respectively. The last 4 words are grouped by twos giving us a total of 10 parts.</li></ul><div>For the tarpaṇa, the following pairs of devatās are worshiped. Each couple can be worshiped together, or separately.</div><div><ul><li>For each of the 4 or 5 bījas, the relevant deva and śakti are worshipped</li><li>For each of the 6 vighneśas, the relevant vighneśa and śakti are worshipped</li><li>The two pairs of aiśvarya devatās are worshipped.</li></ul></div><br />Thus, for the long version, we divide the mantra into 28 parts, and worship the devas and śaktis separately. Thus, we get (28 + (5 + 6 + 2) * 2 ) * 8 = 432 tarpaṇas. An extra 12 tarpaṇas are added to get the magic number 444.<br /><br />We get a short version by offering tarpaṇas only to the devatās, as pairs. Thus, we get (5 + 6 + 2) * 8 = 104. An extra 4 tarpaṇas are added to get to 108.<br /><br />We now look at the various sentence constructions that are used to offer tarpaṇa.<br /><br /><ul><li>śrīm śrī-pati-sahitām śriyam tarpayāmi (stt)</li><li>śrīm śrī-sahitam śrī-patim tarpayāmi (stt)</li><li>śrīm ramā-rameśau tarpayāmi (ps)</li><li>om śrīm ramāṁ tarpayāmi (psss)</li><li>{mūlamantram} tarpayāmi (psss)</li></ul><div>Unlike some prayoga texts, the commentaries on the various tantra texts use well formed, grammatically correct usages. Some traditions suffix everything with "namaḥ", i.e. "tarpayāmi namaḥ". Others prefix even this with svāhā, i.e. "svāhā tarpayāmi namaḥ", but it doesn't come along with matching grammatical change which svāhā requires. The safest thing is to stick to the simpler sentence constructions.</div><div><br /></div><div>The prapañca sāra sāra saṅgraha also assigns bīja prefixes to the vighneśa devatās and aiśvarya devatās. The four bījās are assigned to (a) the first three vighneśa pairs (b) the last three vighneśa pairs (c) the first&nbsp;aiśvarya pair and (d) the last aiśvarya pair respectively.</div><div><br /></div>
