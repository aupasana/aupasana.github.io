Why migrate from google sites to github pages? 

* Github pages use Jekyll with automatic publishing post-commit
* Markdown allows me to focus on content 
* Free hosting for per-account sites, with support for custom domains
* I continue to have a UI surface (github.com) to compose new posts, though it is clunky
