Why migrate from google sites to github pages? 

* Github pages use Jekyll with automatic publishing post-commit
* Markdown allows me to focus on content 
* Free hosting for per-account sites, with support for custom domains
* Editing surfaces (eg. prose.io) allow web-based updates for new posts etc
