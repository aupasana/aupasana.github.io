Why migrate to github pages? 

* Github pages use Jekyll with automatic publishing post-commit
* Github pages allow free hosting for one personal site (with custom domains)
* Easy to integrate a website and blog in one place
* Markdown support allows me to focus on content 
* I continue to have an editing surface (eg. prose.io) for web-based updates
  though it is admittedly clunky
