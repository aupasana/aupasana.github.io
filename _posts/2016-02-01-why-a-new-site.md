Why migrate from google sites to github pages? 

* Because github pages uses Jekyll, I can use markdown for posts, focusing on content
* I can compose and publish new posts using github.com as the blogging UI
* Changes pushed to git go live immediately, without having to generate or push the content
* Free hosting for per-account sites, with support for custom domains
