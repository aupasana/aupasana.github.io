इन्द्रियाध्यशनेऽतृष्णा वासनातानवे स्पृहा ।<br />कार्यालये रमाचिन्ता गृहे कार्यस्य चिन्तनम् ॥<br /><br />When you feast on the senses, you attain dispassion; and when you do the opposite you attain desire. After all, when you at at work, you are thinking about your wife (home life). And, when you are at home, you are busy thinking of work ! &nbsp;(i.e. When you overload the senses at home, you attain dispassion about home and instead desire work. And vice versa)
