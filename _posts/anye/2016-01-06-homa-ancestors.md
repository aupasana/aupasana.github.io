Namaste,

Yes, it is perfectly ok.

Soul, Sun and Rudra are of the nature of fire. Mind, Moon and Devi
are of the nature of water. You can resonate with a soul through the medium
of fire and with a mind through the medium of water. <!--more-->

Devas and rishis identify more with soul than mind and are better reached
through fire. Yet, they too have a mind and Tarpana can be made to them too.

Pitris identify more with mind than soul and better reached through water.
Yet, they too have a soul and offerings in homaagni can be made to them too.

Why submit at anybody's feet? Submit only at Lord's feet.
