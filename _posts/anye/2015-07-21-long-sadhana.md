Namaste,

This is not the age of sadhana. People don't do much sadhana and discourage others who do it. What to do - that is the nature of these times..

There are clearly vasanas pulling you towards sadhana...

If you do not ignore your physical well-being, i.e. sit in a comfortable and sustainable posture and do homa without getting stressed out, there is no harm in doing homa for long hours.

Some people consider it ok to sit in a sofa with a poor posture and watch TV for long hours, but think that doing homa for long hours can be harmful. How strange!

Don't push yourself, enjoy it and do it in a natural way that does not cause physical or mental strain. There is no problem with long hours then.
